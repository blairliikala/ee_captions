0:00:00.719,0:00:05.040
so i'm going to go through the process

0:00:02.000,0:00:06.640
of importing videos from outside of mux

0:00:05.040,0:00:08.880
and expression engine

0:00:06.640,0:00:10.559
and get them into

0:00:08.880,0:00:12.400
both mugs and express engine as new

0:00:10.559,0:00:14.080
entries and new videos so to do that

0:00:12.400,0:00:14.960
we're going to use a add-on called data

0:00:14.080,0:00:16.800
grab

0:00:14.960,0:00:18.720
it's a third party add-on you can buy

0:00:16.800,0:00:21.920
from the expression engine store

0:00:18.720,0:00:24.640
it allows csvs json wordpress and other

0:00:21.920,0:00:27.359
things to be imported as entries

0:00:24.640,0:00:29.920
and i've got a test csv file i've

0:00:27.359,0:00:31.439
created it has the columns that we're

0:00:29.920,0:00:34.480
going to match up to the custom fields

0:00:31.439,0:00:37.040
like title the status uh description and

0:00:34.480,0:00:40.079
then the important one is urls and these

0:00:37.040,0:00:42.800
are both urls from multiple uh locations

0:00:40.079,0:00:45.440
like s3 and like my private server as

0:00:42.800,0:00:46.559
well as a mux id that already exists in

0:00:45.440,0:00:48.480
mux

0:00:46.559,0:00:50.960
so let's go ahead and map those i've put

0:00:48.480,0:00:53.520
the csv file on my server already to

0:00:50.960,0:00:55.600
import i'm going to hit create new csv

0:00:53.520,0:00:57.760
and i'm going to tell it that this is a

0:00:55.600,0:00:59.039
test.csv

0:00:57.760,0:01:01.840
and everything else is the same we're

0:00:59.039,0:01:03.840
going to put this in the events channel

0:01:01.840,0:01:06.240
it's going to read that csv sees the

0:01:03.840,0:01:08.640
columns so we're good so far

0:01:06.240,0:01:10.799
now we need to map the columns to

0:01:08.640,0:01:13.520
the fields in our expression engine

0:01:10.799,0:01:14.960
channel so title should be title

0:01:13.520,0:01:17.119
uh page content is going to be

0:01:14.960,0:01:20.640
description the important one here is

0:01:17.119,0:01:23.520
the mux assets is our url column

0:01:20.640,0:01:25.360
and then actually for status let's just

0:01:23.520,0:01:27.520
let's do status is

0:01:25.360,0:01:29.360
closed we're just that way we can find

0:01:27.520,0:01:31.840
them a lot easier so i'm going to hit

0:01:29.360,0:01:34.720
save this will create that we need to

0:01:31.840,0:01:35.920
test import

0:01:34.720,0:01:37.439
save

0:01:35.920,0:01:39.680
and now we've got that now the first

0:01:37.439,0:01:42.320
thing we need to do is run it and this

0:01:39.680,0:01:44.720
will create the entries and also push

0:01:42.320,0:01:46.560
the videos to mux and we'll get web

0:01:44.720,0:01:50.920
hooks and we'll see all of this

0:01:46.560,0:01:50.920
happening so i'm going to hit go

0:01:57.600,0:02:01.759
cool now it's complete i'm gonna go to

0:01:59.600,0:02:03.520
my channels hit refresh

0:02:01.759,0:02:05.600
and we should now see these closed

0:02:03.520,0:02:07.759
entries are all the new entries so if i

0:02:05.600,0:02:08.879
go to like a big clip which was a really

0:02:07.759,0:02:10.560
big clip that's going to take a little

0:02:08.879,0:02:11.840
while to import

0:02:10.560,0:02:14.720
we're going to see that it's in the

0:02:11.840,0:02:17.599
preparing status now if i go over to the

0:02:14.720,0:02:19.520
mux console we have nine new events that

0:02:17.599,0:02:21.840
were just triggered this was the

0:02:19.520,0:02:23.280
importing of those video files as new

0:02:21.840,0:02:25.680
assets

0:02:23.280,0:02:27.440
as they import i go to some of the other

0:02:25.680,0:02:28.560
ones like one might be really quick this

0:02:27.440,0:02:31.200
one should already be done because it's

0:02:28.560,0:02:33.200
already in mux we can see that it is

0:02:31.200,0:02:35.120
we can also see like music should be

0:02:33.200,0:02:36.640
done

0:02:35.120,0:02:38.239
and

0:02:36.640,0:02:40.640
uh there it is we're just waiting on the

0:02:38.239,0:02:42.879
files to upload and if we go to that big

0:02:40.640,0:02:45.840
clip we're really just waiting for

0:02:42.879,0:02:48.000
the video to finish importing and then

0:02:45.840,0:02:51.200
it will show up there so that's how you

0:02:48.000,0:02:52.879
can import a large number of videos into

0:02:51.200,0:02:54.400
mux and expression engine at the same

0:02:52.879,0:02:55.840
time whether that those videos are

0:02:54.400,0:02:58.000
already in mux

0:02:55.840,0:03:00.159
as ids or as

0:02:58.000,0:03:03.159
urls on a another

0:03:00.159,0:03:03.159
service
